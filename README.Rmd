This is the material released with the paper (_under review_):

* _Model-based tumor subclonal reconstruction_. Giulio Caravagna, Timon Heide, Marc Williams, Luis Zapata, Daniel Nichol, Ketevan Chkhaidze, William Cross, George D. Cresswell, Benjamin Werner, Ahmet Acar, Chris P. Barnes, Guido Sanguinetti, Trevor A. Graham, Andrea Sottoriva. bioRxiv 586560, 2019; [doi:doi.org/10.1101/586560](https://doi.org/10.1101/586560)

The following R packages are required to run the analyses.

* [MOBSTER](https://caravagn.github.io/mobster), to cluster the tumour site frequency spectrum with Beta and Pareto distributions;
* [BMix](https://caravagn.github.io/BMix) and [VIBER](https://caravagn.github.io/VIBER), to model read counts data with Binomial mixtures;
* [CNAqc](https://caravagn.github.io/CNAqc), to integrate mutation and copy number data from bulk sequencing.

A number of other packages are used to generate synthetic data and plots, and are referenced where more appropriate.

Each of  the following vinettes is rendered in HTML. To visualise them you can either download the repository and open it locally; the links below [use a preview website](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).

**1. [Example subclonal dynamics](https://caravagn.github.io/mobster/articles/Example_tumour_simulation.html).**
Simulated example of tumour subclonal evolution with snapshots of tumour
dynamics at different timepoints, and MOBSTER analysis (hosted at [MOBSTER](https://caravagn.github.io/mobster) website).

**2. [Simulated single-sample data analysis](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caravagn/mobster_supp_data/blob/master/Tumor_sim_nospace/Simulated_onesample.html).**  `n = 150` cases with `0` or `1` subclone, with simulated WGS at median coverage 120x. Mutation calls are simulated without copy num data; the coverage is Poisson-distributed.

**3. [Simulated multi-sample data analysis](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caravagn/mobster_supp_data/blob/master/Tumor_sim_space/Simulated_multisample.html).**  `n = 15` cases of spatially growing tumours (2D) with `0`, `1` or `2` subclones, with simulated WGS at median coverage 120x. Mutation calls are simulated without copy num data; the coverage is Poisson-distributed.

**4. [Single-sample cross-sectional lung cases](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caravagn/mobster_supp_data/blob/master/Lungs/Real_data_lungs.html).**  `n = 2` lung cancer cases with `0` subclones, with  WGS at median coverage ~100x. Mutation calls are and copy num data are available from the [COALA](http://genome.kaist.ac.kr/). Code in this vignette can be used also to re-analyse the breast and AML case samples that we discuss in the paper (see the papers for data availability).

**5. [Multi-region cross-sectional colorectal caricnomas](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caravagn/mobster_supp_data/blob/master/CRC/CRC_vignette.html).**  2 colorectal cancer cases with multiple biopsies each, with  WGS at median coverage ~100x. These are new data first released with this paper. Code in this vignette can be used also to replicate the results that we discuss in the paper. 

**6. [PCAWG analysis](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caravagn/mobster_supp_data/blob/master/PCAWG/PCAWG_analysis_table.html).** Summary statistics for  `n = 2566` cases of different cancers (pan-cancer). This cohort has WGS single-samples with coverage ~45x. Mutation and copy number calls that we used have been generated by the PCAWG consortium.

**7. [GBM analysis](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caravagn/mobster_supp_data/blob/master/GBM/GBM_analysis_table.html).** Summary statistics for `n = 71` longitudinal GBM biopsies This cohort has WGS primary/ relapse samples with coverage ~100x. Mutation and copy number calls that we used have been generated by the orugunal authors
