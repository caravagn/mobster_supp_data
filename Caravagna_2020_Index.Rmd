This is the material released with the paper G.Caravagna et al. *Model-based tumour subclonal deconvolution.*; accepted in principle at Nature Genetics, 2020. You can still refer to the [biorXiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/586560v1) of the paper.

The following R packages are required to run the analyses.

* [MOBSTER](https://caravagn.github.io/mobster), to cluster the tumour site frequency spectrum with Beta and Pareto distributions;
* [BMix](https://caravagn.github.io/BMix) and [VIBER](https://caravagn.github.io/VIBER), to model read counts data with Binomial mixtures;
* [CNAqc](https://caravagn.github.io/CNAqc), to integrate mutation and copy number data from bulk sequencing.

**1. [Example subclonal dynamics](./Tumor_sim_example/Example_tumour_simulation.html).** Simulated example of tumour subclonal evolution with snapshots of tumour dynamics at different timepoints, and MOBSTER analysis.

**2. [Simulated single-sample data analysis](./Tumor_sim_nospace/Simulated_onesample.html).**  `n = 150` cases with `0` or `1` subclone, with simulated WGS at median coverage 120x. Mutation calls are simulated without copy num data; the coverage is Poisson-distributed.

**3. [Simulated multi-sample data analysis](./Tumor_sim_space/Simulated_multisample.html).**  `n = 15` cases of spatially growing tumours (2D) with `0`, `1` or `2` subclones, with simulated WGS at median coverage 120x. Mutation calls are simulated without copy num data; the coverage is Poisson-distributed.

**4. [Single-sample cross-sectional lung cases](./Lungs/Real_data_lungs.html).**  `n = 2` lung cancer cases with `0` subclones, with  WGS at median coverage ~100x. Mutation calls are and copy num data are available from the [COALA](http://genome.kaist.ac.kr/). Code in this vignette can be used also to re-analyse the breast and AML case samples that we discuss in the paper (see the papers for data availability).

**5. [Multi-region cross-sectional colorectal caricnomas](./CRC/CRC_vignette.html).**  2 colorectal cancer cases with multiple biopsies each, with  WGS at median coverage ~100x. These are new data first released with this paper. Code in this vignette can be used also to replicate the results that we discuss in the paper. 

**6. [PCAWG analysis](./PCAWG/PCAWG_analysis_table.html).** Summary statistics for  `n = 2566` cases of different cancers (pan-cancer). This cohort has WGS single-samples with coverage ~45x. Mutation and copy number calls that we used have been generated by the PCAWG consortium.

**7. [GBM analysis](./GBM/GBM_analysis_table.html).** Summary statistics for `n = 71` longitudinal GBM biopsies This cohort has WGS primary/ relapse samples with coverage ~100x. Mutation and copy number calls that we used have been generated by the orugunal authors
